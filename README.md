# Org Chart App

This is a simple Rails/React project built by Pingboard as a jumping off point for take home projects.

# Getting started

Setup your environment:

- Install Ruby 2.6.3
- `gem install bundler` to install Bundler
- Install Node.js (version 12 or greater is recommended) ([instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
- Install Yarn `^1.22.5` ([instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))

To get the Rails server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `bundle install` to install required Ruby dependencies
- `yarn` to install JavaScript dependencies
- `rake db:migrate` to run database migrations
- `rake db:seed` to add some data
- `rails s` to start the local server on port 3000 (make sure to stop any other servers that might be listening on that port!)

# Run tests

`bundle exec rake`
